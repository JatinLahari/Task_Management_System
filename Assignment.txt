Assignment: Build a RESTful Task Management API
---------------------------------------------------------
📘 Objective:
Create a fully functional REST API to manage users and their personal task lists. This API should support user authentication and CRUD operations for tasks.

🧱 Tech Stack:
Node.js  ------------------> Used

Express.js ----------------> Used

JWT (Authentication)  -----> Used

bcrypt.js (Password hashing) --> Used

MySQL with Sequelize (or MongoDB with Mongoose — your choice) ----> Used

dotenv (for environment variables) ---> Used

cookie-parser ---> Used

📌 Requirements:
1. User Authentication
Routes:
POST /api/register – Register a new user  --> Done

POST /api/login – Login and receive a JWT token in cookies --> Done

GET /api/profile – Get logged-in user profile --> Done

POST /api/logout – Clear the authentication cookie  --> Done

User Model:    --> Done
js
Copy
Edit
{
  id: UUID,
  name: String,
  email: String (unique),
  password: String (hashed),
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
2. Task Management (Protected Routes)  --> Done
Routes:
POST /api/tasks – Create a new task  --> Done

GET /api/tasks – Get all tasks for logged-in user   --> Done

GET /api/tasks/:id – Get task by ID    --> Done

PUT /api/tasks/:id – Update a task     --> Done

DELETE /api/tasks/:id – Delete a task  --> Done

Task Model:  --> Done
js
Copy
Edit
{
  id: UUID,
  title: String,
  description: String,
  status: Enum ["pending", "in-progress", "completed"],
  dueDate: Date,
  userId: UUID (foreign key),
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
🔐 Authentication Middleware:
Protect all /api/tasks routes using a JWT-based middleware.   --> Done

Use a cookie to store the token (set httpOnly, secure in production).    --> Done

✨ Bonus Features (Optional)
Filter tasks by status or dueDate

Pagination on the GET /api/tasks

Use bcrypt.compare() asynchronously

Add soft delete (isDeleted flag)

Add file upload (e.g., task attachments)

Swagger documentation

🧪 Deliverables:
A GitHub repo with clear instructions to run the project:

ini
Copy
Edit
# .env file example
DB_URL=...
JWT_SECRET=...
PORT=3000
Include a Postman collection or API documentation (can be markdown or Swagger).

📚 Learning Goals:
Design and implement real-world REST APIs

Understand JWT-based auth and middleware protection

Practice with a database ORM (Sequelize or Mongoose)

Use environment variables and secure cookie handling
